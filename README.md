# tricky-colors

This is a game created during Unity training week. The objective of the game is to control a color-changing ball that can only go through obstacles that match its color. The player must keep moving forward and avoid other colors.

To give the ball momentum, tap the screen. The ball will change its color randomly as it progresses through the game. The game has a high score system to keep track of the player's progress.

## Instructions
The game can be played directly from the Unity Engine. Simply open the project file and run it. 
It also can be installed on Android device by downloading `androidi.zip`, unzipping it and installing `androidi.apk` on Android.

## Future Development
No further development is planned for this game. 
However, anyone is welcome to use the code to create their own game or modify the existing one.
