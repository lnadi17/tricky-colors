# Tricky Colors

This is a game created during Unity training week. The objective of the game is to control a color-changing ball that can only go through obstacles that match its color. The player must keep moving forward and avoid other colors.

To give the ball momentum, tap the screen. The ball will change its color randomly as it progresses through the game. The game has a high score system to keep track of the player's progress.
